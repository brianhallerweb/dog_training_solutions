	    <img src="./profile.png" height=200/>
	    <div>UPDATE: As of 2019, I am only available for training in special
	    circumstances. Here is what you need to know if you would like to
	    work with me:<div>

		    <ul>
			    <li> I am available in Berkeley, CA and Missoula,
				    MT. I travel between Montana and California
			    regularly so I am frequently available in both
			    locations. </li>
			    <li> I only train dogs as a part time business.
				    My rate is $100 per hour. 
			     </li>
			    <li> 
				    I only work with clients who are looking
				    specifically for my style of dog training
				    (off leash recall and heel with an electric
				    collar). 
			    </li> 
			    <li>
				    I do not work with dogs under 6
				    months old or under 25 pounds. 
			     </li>
		    </ul>
	<div>Feel free to contact me at brianshaller@gmail.com if you would
		like more information.</div>
